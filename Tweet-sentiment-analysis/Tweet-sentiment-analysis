This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on tweets related to data science, 
with the goal of classifying them into positive and negative sentiments. Sentiment analysis is 
a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows for the extraction of 
meaningful insights from large volumes of text data. By analysing the sentiments expressed in 
social media platforms like Twitter, organizations and researchers can gain valuable feedback 
on public opinion, emerging trends, and overall sentiment toward specific topics. 
The project begins with data pre-processing, where the raw tweet data is cleaned by removing 
irrelevant elements such as URLs, special characters, hashtags, and mentions, followed by the 
conversion of the text to lowercase and tokenization. To convert the text into a numerical 
representation, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is 
applied, which helps in identifying the most important words in the dataset that contribute to 
the sentiment classification. 
For the sentiment classification task, the project employs the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes 
algorithm, a probabilistic model that is well-suited for text classification tasks. This model 
works by calculating the likelihood of a given word being associated with a specific sentiment, 
based on the training data. The sentiment classification pipeline is built using Scikit-learn, a 
widely used machine learning library, which facilitates the integration of pre-processing, 
feature extraction, and model training. 
The performance of the model is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide a comprehensive understanding of how well 
the model is classifying tweets. Additionally, several visualizations are created to interpret the 
results and offer insights into the data, including sentiment distribution plots, word clouds, and 
confusion matrices. These visual tools help to highlight the frequency of positive and negative 
tweets, the most common words associated with each sentiment, and the classification errors 
made by the model.
